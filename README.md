# ðŸŒŸ Wikipedia Reimagined

Welcome to my Wikipedia Reimagined project - the result of purely **vibe coding**! âœ¨

## What is "Vibe Coding"?
Vibe coding is when you let creativity and intuition guide your development process rather than rigid planning. This project emerged organically as I followed my creative instincts and built features that felt right in the moment.

## What I've Built

This project is a modern take on Wikipedia with some fun, innovative twists:

### Core Features
- ðŸ“š Full article browsing experience with Wikipedia content
- ðŸ§  AI-powered TL;DR summaries for quick comprehension
- ðŸ‘¶ "Explain Like I'm 5" simplified explanations
- ðŸ”„ Flashcard generation for learning key concepts
- ðŸ“± Responsive design that works on all devices

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React with Material-UI for a clean, modern interface
- **Backend**: Node.js & Express
- **Data**: Wikipedia API integration
- **AI**: Google Gemini API for content summaries and flashcards

## Why This Project?

I created this to explore how we might improve the knowledge consumption experience. Wikipedia is amazing, but sometimes overwhelming - my reimagined version aims to make learning more accessible, enjoyable, and tailored to different learning styles.

## Try It Out!

Feel free to clone this repo and explore! You'll need to:
1. Create a `.env` file with your Gemini API key (`GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here`)
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Start the app with `npm start`

## Future Vibes

This project is constantly evolving as new inspiration strikes. Potential future additions include:
- Mind mapping feature
- Voice narration of articles
- User-customized learning paths
